        <h3 class="secHeading"><u>Know Your Area</u></h3>
        <p class="text">
          The "Know Your Area" feature is at the heart of Nirbhayam, designed to help women navigate their environment 
          with a clear understanding of safety conditions. This section provides users with real-time safety ratings 
          for different areas based on various factors, including crime data, lighting conditions, and community reports.
          <br />
          <br />
          It also offers a safe route planner that suggests the most secure paths for walking, driving, or using public 
          transport. Dynamic alerts keep users updated on potential risks such as accidents, protests, or hazardous zones, 
          enabling them to make informed decisions on the go. This feature ensures every journey is planned with safety as 
          the top priority, empowering users to travel with confidence.

        <p class="text">
          Nirbhayam extends its support beyond technology by equipping women with practical knowledge and skills through 
          the Workshops and Daily Self-Defense tab. This section offers daily tips and video tutorials on essential 
          self-defense techniques, enabling users to protect themselves in threatening situations. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, it provides access to live virtual workshops led by certified trainers, covering topics such as 
          situational awareness, personal safety strategies, and mental resilience. Users can also explore legal resources 
          to understand their rights and navigate the legal system effectively. By blending education, empowerment, and actionable 
          strategies, this tab ensures women are prepared to face challenges both physically and mentally.

          <h2 class="desc">Impact Tracker</h2>
        </div>
        <h3 class="secHeading"><u>Impact Tracker</u></h3>
        <p class="text">
          The "Impact Tracker" is a feature designed to empower users by allowing them to highlight and upvote safety issues within their community,
           ensuring that accountability is driven by the collective input of the community. This functionality fosters active participation and 
           collaboration, enabling individuals to draw attention to specific concerns like damaged streetlights or areas in need of increased police 
           patrols. The tracker not only helps in raising awareness but also plays a crucial role in monitoring the effectiveness of reported safety 
           measures. For instance, once a safety issue, such as a broken streetlight, is fixed, users can track the progress and assess the impact 
           of the corrective action. Similarly, if additional police patrols are implemented in response to community concerns, the tracker allows 
           users to evaluate how these measures contribute to improving safety, ensuring that necessary actions are being taken and that public 
           safety continues to improve through a transparent, community-driven approach.
