# Nirbhayam
Working on this project for my idea that I present in  Smart India Ideathon 2025.......................

## Problem Statement : 
Women’s safety remains a critical issue, with systemic gaps in real-time risk management, 
community participation, and policy awareness. Current solutions often fail to holistically 
address physical safety, legal education, and collective accountability. How can we leverage 
technology to provide women with safer spaces, actionable insights, and a sense of 
empowerment?

## What I aim to make ?
##Key Features : 

1. Dynamic Safety Index for Locations : 
o Interactive Map: A real-time safety index displayed for different locations 
based on live data from CCTV networks, crime reports, lighting conditions, and 
community feedback. 
o Safety Heatmaps: Highlight areas based on historical and current safety 
conditions, enabling users to avoid high-risk zones. 
o Predictive Analytics: AI-powered prediction of potential unsafe events based 
on time, location, and historical trends. 
2. Women-Specific Navigation : 
o SafeRoute Planner: Suggests the safest routes for walking, driving, or using 
public transport by factoring in lighting, crowd density, and real-time reports. 
o Landmark-Based Navigation: Highlights safe public spaces like police 
stations, pink booths, and well-lit zones along the route. 
3. Community Safety Ecosystem : 
o Crowd-Sourced Alerts: Users can report unsafe incidents (e.g., harassment, 
poorly lit streets) to keep the community informed. 
o Local Guardian Network: Build a volunteer network for immediate help, 
including trained responders, local authorities, and verified volunteers. 
o "Eyes and Ears" Initiative: Encourage residents to participate in neighborhood 
safety through workshops and digital tools. 
4. ShaktiPath – Knowledge and Empowerment Hub:  
o Legal Rights Awareness: A section educating women about legal provisions 
like the Sexual Harassment Act, Domestic Violence Act, and Cyber Crime laws. 
o Workshops and Tutorials: Resources for self-defense techniques, situational 
awareness, and mental resilience. 
o Women-Centric Policies: Simplified explanations of government safety 
initiatives like the Nirbhaya Fund and Safe City Project. 
5. Emergency Assistance and Quick Response : 
o Panic Button Integration: Activate a high-alert mode in emergencies with a 
single button, broadcasting real-time location, recording audio, and sending 
alerts to emergency contacts, local police, and nearby guardians  
o Silent Mode: Discreet SOS activation to avoid escalating threats. 
o Voice Recording: Combines immediate help-seeking with evidence collection. 
6. Impact Tracker 
o Users can highlight & upvote issues, ensuring community-driven accountability. 
o Monitor the effectiveness of reported safety measures, such as fixing broken 
streetlights or increasing police patrols.

## Technology Stack : 
o Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS 
o Backend: Node.js, Express.js 
o Database: MongoDB 
o Real-Time Data: Tom Tom API, OpenStreetMap, and WebSockets 
o AI & Analytics: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), Predictive Modeling Algorithms 
o Cloud Infrastructure: AWS (S3, Lambda), Firebase (for real-time updates)

## Expected Outcome : 
o Reduction in reported incidents of harassment and violence in pilot areas. 
o Increased community engagement through crowd-sourced safety reports. 
o Enhanced user confidence and adoption rates measured through surveys.
